**Python Lecture 2: Control Flow in Python**

**Duration:** 3 hours  

---

## **1. Introduction to Control Flow**  
Control flow determines the order in which instructions in a program are executed. Python provides conditional statements and loops to control program execution.  

### **Topics Covered:**
- If-else statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Logical operators
- Break and continue statements
- Nested loops and conditionals

---

## **2. If-Else Statements**  
Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.

### **Syntax:**  
```python
if condition:
    # Code block
elif another_condition:
    # Another code block
else:
    # Default code block
```

### **Example:**  
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```

### **Practice Problems:**
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program that takes a user's marks and prints whether they passed (>=50) or failed.

---

## **3. Logical Operators**  
Logical operators help evaluate multiple conditions.

### **Operators:**
- `and` - Returns `True` if both conditions are true.
- `or` - Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.
- `not` - Reverses the result.

### **Example:**  
```python
temp = int(input("Enter temperature: "))
if temp > 30 and temp < 40:
    print("It's hot outside!")
```

### **Practice Problems:**
3. Write a program to check if a number is in the range 1-100.
4. Write a program to check if a year is a leap year.

---

## **4. Loops in Python**
Loops are used to repeat code multiple times.

### **4.1 For Loop**  
Used for iterating over sequences.

#### **Syntax:**  
```python
for variable in iterable:
    # Code block
```

#### **Example:**  
```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration", i)
```

#### **Example (Looping through a list):**  
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### **Practice Problems:**
5. Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
6. Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number.

---

### **4.2 While Loop**  
Used when the number of iterations is not fixed.

#### **Syntax:**  
```python
while condition:
    # Code block
```

#### **Example:**  
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is", count)
    count += 1
```

### **Practice Problems:**
7. Write a program that prints numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.
8. Write a program to keep asking for a password until the correct one is entered.

---

## **5. Break and Continue Statements**

### **Break Statement:**
Used to exit a loop prematurely.

#### **Example:**  
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

### **Continue Statement:**
Skips the rest of the loop for the current iteration.

#### **Example:**  
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### **Practice Problems:**
9. Write a program that stops printing numbers at 5 using a break statement.
10. Write a program that skips number 3 when printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a continue statement.

---

## **6. Nested Loops and Conditionals**  
Python allows loops and conditionals to be nested inside each other.

#### **Example:**  
```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print("i:", i, "j:", j)
```

#### **Example (Nested If):**  
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive even number")
    else:
        print("Positive odd number")
```

### **Practice Problems:**
11. Write a program that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
12. Write a program that finds all even numbers between 1 and 20 using nested if conditions.

---

## **7. Homework Assignment**  
1. Write a program to check if a number is prime.
2. Write a program that prints Fibonacci numbers up to `n` terms.
3. Write a program to count the number of vowels in a given string.
4. Write a program that asks for a number and prints whether it is odd or even.
5. Write a program to print the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 using a loop.
