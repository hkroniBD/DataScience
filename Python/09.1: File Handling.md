# Lecture: Handling Text, Excel, and CSV Files using Python

## 1. Introduction

Data handling is a fundamental aspect of programming and data analysis. Python provides multiple libraries to efficiently read, write, and manipulate text, Excel, and CSV files.

## 2. Handling Text Files

### Reading a Text File

```python
# Open and read a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
print(content)
```

### Writing to a Text File

```python
# Write to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a sample text file.")
```

### Appending to a Text File

```python
# Append text to an existing file
with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nAdding new content to the file.")
```

### Reading a Text File Line by Line

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

## 3. Handling CSV Files

### Reading a CSV File using `csv` Module

```python
import csv

with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

### Writing to a CSV File

```python
with open("output.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 25, "New York"])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 30, "Los Angeles"])
```

### Using Pandas for CSV Handling

```python
import pandas as pd

# Reading a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())

# Writing DataFrame to CSV
df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
```

## 4. Handling Excel Files

### Reading an Excel File using `pandas`

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read an Excel file
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx")
print(df.head())
```

### Writing to an Excel File

```python
# Writing DataFrame to Excel
df.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=False)
```

### Reading Specific Sheets

```python
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
```

### Writing to Multiple Sheets

```python
with pd.ExcelWriter("multi_sheets.xlsx") as writer:
    df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Sheet1")
    df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Sheet2")
```

## 5. Summary

- **Text Files:** Use `open()` with modes `r`, `w`, and `a`.
- **CSV Files:** Use `csv` module or `pandas.read_csv()` for easier handling.
- **Excel Files:** Use `pandas.read_excel()` and `to_excel()` for reading and writing.

## 6. Practice Tasks

1. Read a text file and count the number of lines.
2. Create a CSV file with sample student data.
3. Read an Excel file and filter rows based on a condition.
