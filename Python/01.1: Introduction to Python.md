## **1. What is Python?**  
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more.

### **Key Features of Python:**  
- **Easy to learn:** Simple syntax similar to English.  
- **Interpreted language:** Executes code line by line.  
- **Dynamically typed:** No need to declare variable types.  
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
- **Large community support:** Many libraries and frameworks available.

## **2. Installing Python**  
- Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- Install and verify using:  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
- Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):  
  - **IDLE (built-in)**  
  - **VS Code**  
  - **PyCharm**  
  - **Jupyter Notebook** (for data science)

## **3. Writing Your First Python Program**  
Python uses **.py** files for scripts.  

### **Example: Hello World**  
Save the following as `hello.py` and run it:  
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### **Executing Python Code:**  
- In the terminal:  
  ```bash
  python hello.py
  ```
- Using an interactive shell:  
  ```python
  >>> print("Hello, World!")
  ```

---

## **4. Python Syntax and Structure**  
Python uses indentation instead of `{}` or `;` (like C or Java).  

### **Example: Proper Indentation**  
```python
if True:
    print("This is correct indentation")
```

### **Example: Incorrect Indentation (Throws an error)**
```python
if True:
print("This will cause an IndentationError")
```

## **5. Variables and Data Types**  
### **Declaring Variables**  
```python
name = "John"   # String
age = 25        # Integer
height = 5.8    # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

### **Checking Data Types**  
```python
print(type(name))   # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))    # <class 'int'>
print(type(height)) # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student)) # <class 'bool'>
```

---

## **6. Basic Input and Output**  
### **Taking User Input**  
```python
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", user_name)
```

### **Converting Input Type**  
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1)
```

---

## **7. Comments in Python**  
- **Single-line comments:**  
  ```python
  # This is a comment
  print("Hello, Python!")  # This is also a comment
  ```
- **Multi-line comments:**  
  ```python
  """
  This is a multi-line comment
  that spans multiple lines.
  """
  ```

---

## **8. Basic Operators**  
### **Arithmetic Operators**  
```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
print(a // b) # Floor Division
print(a % b)  # Modulus
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation
```

### **Comparison Operators**
```python
print(a == b)  # Equal to
print(a != b)  # Not equal to
print(a > b)   # Greater than
print(a < b)   # Less than
```

---

## **9. Additional Python Data Types**
### **Lists**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # apple
print(len(fruits)) # 3
```

### **Tuples**
```python
tuple_example = (10, 20, 30)
print(tuple_example[1])  # 20
```

### **Dictionaries**
```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # John
```

---

## **10. Practice Problems**  
### **Beginner Level**  
1. Write a program that prints "Python is amazing!"  
2. Write a program that takes your name as input and greets you.  
3. Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.  

### **Intermediate Level**  
4. Write a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
5. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given length and width.  

### **Advanced Level**
6. Write a program that stores a list of five favorite movies and prints them one by one.
7. Create a dictionary storing information about a student (name, age, grade) and display it.

---

## **11. Homework Assignment**  
1. Write a Python program that asks for two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
2. Modify the program to check if the first number is greater than the second.  
3. Write a program that calculates the perimeter of a circle given the radius.  
4. Write a program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.  
5. Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
