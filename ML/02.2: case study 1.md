6. Python Implementation

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
data = fetch_california_housing()
X = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)
y = pd.Series(data.target, name="MedHouseVal")

# EDA - Correlation heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(X.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Feature Correlation")
plt.show()

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.3f}")
print(f"R-squared Score: {r2:.3f}")


---

7. Interpretation

Evaluate performance via RMSE and RÂ².

Analyze feature coefficients to interpret their influence on house prices.



---

8. Summary

A supervised regression model was built using the California Housing dataset.

Model evaluation shows how well median house prices can be predicted from socio-economic features.

This analysis demonstrates the practical application of supervised learning in real estate data.

9. Assignment/Extension Suggestions

Try other models: DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, SVR

Use feature scaling and compare effects

Perform cross-validation

Visualize feature importances
