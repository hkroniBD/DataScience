# **ðŸ“Š 5-Day ML for Data Analysis Workshop**  
**Goal:** *Teach ML as a tool for data analysisâ€”students will learn when and how to apply ML vs. traditional methods.*  

### **Day 1: Intro to ML for Data Analysis**  
**Theme:** *"Why ML? When to Use It Over Excel/Stats?"*  
1. **Essential Theory (30 min):**  
   - What is ML? How is it different from traditional data analysis?  
     - *Example:* Linear regression (stats) vs. ML regression (handles messy data better).  
   - When to use ML:  
     - Large datasets, non-linear patterns, automation needs.  
2. **Hands-On:**  
   - Load a dataset (e.g., sales data) in Pandas.  
   - Compare:  
     - Excel pivot tables vs. ML clustering (e.g., customer segments).  
   - **Coding:** Basic EDA (summary stats, correlations).

### **Day 2: Regression for Predictive Analysis**  
**Theme:** *"Predicting Numbers: When Linear Models Fail"*  
1. **Essential Theory (20 min):**  
   - When to use regression (continuous outcomes: sales, prices).  
   - Limitations of linear models (non-linear data â†’ decision trees).  
2. **Hands-On:**  
   - Train linear regression (house prices).  
   - Try decision tree regression (better for non-linear trends).  
   - **Compare:** RMSE of both models.

### **Day 3: Classification for Categorical Data**  
**Theme:** *"Sorting Data into Buckets"*  
1. **Essential Theory (20 min):**  
   - When to classify (e.g., customer churn, spam detection).  
   - Key models: Logistic regression vs. Random Forest.  
2. **Hands-On:**  
   - Predict customer churn (logistic regression).  
   - Improve accuracy with Random Forest.  
   - **Compare:** Precision/recall for business decisions.

### **Day 4: Clustering for Unlabeled Data**  
**Theme:** *"Finding Hidden Groups in Your Data"*  
1. **Essential Theory (20 min):**  
   - When clustering beats manual analysis (e.g., market segmentation).  
   - K-Means vs. hierarchical clustering.  
2. **Hands-On:**  
   - Group customers by spending habits.  
   - **Business insight:** Which clusters are most profitable?

### **Day 5: Capstone + ML Limitations**  
**Theme:** *"When *Not* to Use ML"*  
1. **Essential Theory (30 min):**  
   - ML vs. traditional stats: Overkill for small, clean datasets.  
   - Bias/interpretability trade-offs.  
2. **Hands-On:**  
   - **Project:** Analyze a messy dataset (e.g., healthcare).  
     - Try traditional stats (fail), then ML (succeed).  
   - **Deploy:** Streamlit dashboard for stakeholders.

### **Key Theory Takeaways (Daily 20â€“30 Min):**  
- **Day 1:** ML vs. traditional analysis.  
- **Day 2:** Regression vs. curve-fitting.  
- **Day 3:** Classification thresholds (precision vs. recall).  
- **Day 4:** Clustering for exploration.  
- **Day 5:** When ML fails (small data, overfitting).  

### **Why ML for Data Analysis?**  
- Handles **messy, large datasets** (Excel crashes).  
- Finds **non-linear patterns** (traditional stats miss).  
- Automates **repetitive analysis** (e.g., real-time fraud detection).  

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.  
**Datasets:** Sales, customer churn, healthcare, marketing.

### **Adjustments?**  
- Add more **business case studies** (e.g., A/B testing vs. ML)?  
- Include **SQL + ML integration**?  
- Focus on **specific industries** (finance, healthcare)?  

Let me know! This balances **theory + practice** while keeping the focus on **data analysis**.
