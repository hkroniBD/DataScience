# **Python Programming - Lecture 1: Introduction to Python**

## **1. What is Python?**
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.

### **Key Features of Python:**
- **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax similar to English.
- **Interpreted**: Executes code line by line, making debugging easier.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Open-Source**: Free to use and modify.
- **Large Community**: Supportive community and extensive libraries.

## **2. Installing Python**
To start programming in Python, you need to install it on your computer.

### **Steps to Install Python:**
1. **Download Python**:  
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version.
2. **Install Python**:  
   - Run the installer and check **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking Install.
3. **Verify Installation**:  
   - Open the terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and type:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - If installed correctly, it will show the Python version.

## **3. Running Python Code**
There are three main ways to run Python code:

### **1. Using the Python Interpreter (Interactive Mode)**
- Open **Command Prompt** or **Terminal** and type:
  ```bash
  python
  ```
- You can directly type and execute Python commands:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
- To exit, type `exit()` or press `Ctrl + Z` (Windows) / `Ctrl + D` (Linux/Mac).

### **2. Using a Python Script File**
- Create a new file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `first_program.py`.
- Write the following code in the file:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
- Save the file and run it in the terminal using:
  ```bash
  python first_program.py
  ```

### **3. Using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
- Recommended IDEs: **PyCharm, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or IDLE**.
- Open the IDE, write Python code, and run it with a single click.

## **4. First Python Program**
Now, letâ€™s write our first simple Python program:

```python
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
```

**Explanation:**
- `print()` is a built-in function used to display text on the screen.
- The text inside `" "` (double quotes) is printed.

**Expected Output:**
```
Welcome to Python Programming!
```

## **5. Python as a Calculator**
Python can also perform mathematical operations:

```python
print(5 + 3)   # Addition
print(10 - 2)  # Subtraction
print(4 * 3)   # Multiplication
print(8 / 2)   # Division
print(10 % 3)  # Modulus (Remainder)
```

**Output:**
```
8
8
12
4.0
1
```

---

## **6. Variables in Python**
A **variable** is used to store data in Python.

Example:
```python
name = "John"
age = 25
height = 5.8

print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
```

**Output:**
```
John
25
5.8
```

---

### **Conclusion**
- You learned what Python is, how to install it, and how to write and execute simple programs.
- You wrote your first Python program and used Python as a calculator.
- You learned about variables.
