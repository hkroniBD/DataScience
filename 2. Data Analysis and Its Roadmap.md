# Lecture 2: Data Analysis and Its Roadmap

## 1. Introduction to Data Analysis
### What is Data Analysis?
- Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information and support decision-making.
- It helps in identifying trends, making predictions, and optimizing processes.

### Importance of Data Analysis
- Aids in informed decision-making across various domains such as finance, healthcare, business, and research.
- Helps organizations optimize performance by identifying key patterns and trends.
- Supports predictive analytics and forecasting for future insights.

## 2. Steps in Data Analysis

### **Step 1: Define the Problem**
- Identify the research or business question.
- Determine objectives, scope, and key metrics.

### **Step 2: Data Collection**
- Gather data from sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, CSV files, and surveys.
- Ensure data reliability and credibility.

### **Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values (Imputation, Deletion).
- Remove duplicates and fix inconsistencies.
- Convert data types and normalize/standardize data.
- Handle outliers using statistical techniques.

### **Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Summarize data using descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
- Visualize data with histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
- Identify correlations and patterns.

### **Step 5: Data Transformation & Feature Engineering**
- Select relevant features to enhance predictive performance.
- Encode categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
- Scale numerical data (Normalization, Standardization).

### **Step 6: Model Selection & Data Modeling**
- Choose appropriate statistical or machine learning models based on the problem.
- Train models using training datasets and validate them with test datasets.
- Tune hyperparameters for improved model accuracy.

### **Step 7: Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate models using performance metrics such as:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (for classification problems).
  - RMSE, R-squared (for regression problems).
- Validate assumptions and check for overfitting/underfitting.

### **Step 8: Insights & Visualization**
- Present key findings using data storytelling techniques.
- Create reports and dashboards using visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Matplotlib.

### **Step 9: Deployment & Monitoring**
- Deploy models using cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or APIs.
- Continuously monitor model performance and retrain when necessary.
