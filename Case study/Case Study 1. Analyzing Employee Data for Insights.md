### **Case Study: Analyzing Employee Data for Insights**

#### **Problem Statement:**
A company wants to analyze its employee data to understand basic trends such as employee distribution across departments, salary distribution, and employee retention rates. The company also wants to know if there is any correlation between factors like age and salary.

**Objective:**
To analyze employee data, clean the dataset, and perform basic analysis to uncover patterns that can help in better decision-making. The goal is to:

1. Perform data cleaning and basic preprocessing.
2. Explore employee distribution by department.
3. Analyze salary distribution.
4. Identify trends in employee retention.
5. Investigate if there are correlations between age and salary.

### **Dataset:**
The employee data contains the following columns:

- `Employee_ID`: Unique identifier for each employee.
- `Name`: Name of the employee.
- `Age`: Age of the employee.
- `Gender`: Gender of the employee (Male/Female).
- `Department`: Department where the employee works (e.g., HR, Sales, Marketing).
- `Salary`: Monthly salary of the employee.
- `Years_at_Company`: The number of years the employee has been working at the company.
- `Is_Active`: Boolean indicating whether the employee is still working with the company (True/False).

### **Step 1: Dataset Creation**

Hereâ€™s a simple example of an employee dataset in CSV format:

```csv
Employee_ID,Name,Age,Gender,Department,Salary,Years_at_Company,Is_Active
1,John Doe,29,Male,Sales,5000,5,True
2,Jane Smith,34,Female,Marketing,6000,7,True
3,Sam Johnson,45,Male,HR,5500,10,False
4,Emily Davis,28,Female,Sales,4800,4,True
5,Michael Brown,39,Male,IT,7000,8,True
6,Laura Wilson,32,Female,Marketing,6500,6,False
7,James Moore,25,Male,Sales,4500,3,True
8,Linda Taylor,40,Female,HR,5800,9,True
9,Robert Lee,50,Male,IT,7500,12,True
10,Karen White,30,Female,Sales,5000,4,True
```

#### **CSV File Creation**:
You can copy and paste the above data into a text editor and save it as `employee_data.csv`.

---

### **Step 2: Data Loading and Overview**

Let's load and explore the dataset using **Pandas**:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the employee data
data = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv')

# Show basic information about the dataset
print(data.info())

# Show the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

---

### **Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

#### **Checking for Missing Values**

Check for any missing or null values in the dataset:

```python
# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())
```

If there are any missing values, we could either drop or fill them. In this dataset, there are no missing values, but if there were, we might use `data.fillna()` or `data.dropna()`.

#### **Converting Data Types**

Ensure that the `Is_Active` column is a boolean and the `Salary` and `Years_at_Company` are numeric:

```python
data['Is_Active'] = data['Is_Active'].astype(bool)
```

---

### **Step 4: Data Analysis**

#### **1. Employee Distribution by Department**

We can analyze how many employees are in each department:

```python
# Count employees in each department
department_counts = data['Department'].value_counts()

# Plot the employee distribution by department
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
department_counts.plot(kind='bar', title='Employee Distribution by Department')
plt.xlabel('Department')
plt.ylabel('Number of Employees')
plt.show()
```

#### **2. Salary Distribution**

Next, we will analyze the salary distribution across all employees:

```python
# Plot salary distribution
data['Salary'].hist(bins=10, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Salary Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Salary')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

#### **3. Age and Salary Correlation**

Check for any correlation between the age of employees and their salary:

```python
# Scatter plot to visualize correlation between age and salary
plt.scatter(data['Age'], data['Salary'], color='green')
plt.title('Age vs Salary')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()

# Calculate correlation
correlation = data[['Age', 'Salary']].corr()
print(correlation)
```

#### **4. Employee Retention Analysis**

Analyze employee retention by looking at employees who are no longer with the company (where `Is_Active = False`):

```python
# Count active vs inactive employees
retention_counts = data['Is_Active'].value_counts()

# Plot retention analysis
retention_counts.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', colors=['lightgreen', 'lightcoral'], title='Employee Retention')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()
```

### **Step 5: Conclusion and Insights**

Based on the data analysis, we might uncover the following insights:

1. **Employee Distribution by Department**: We could identify which department has the highest number of employees, helping HR plan for recruitment and resource allocation.
2. **Salary Distribution**: By observing the salary distribution, we can identify salary ranges and gaps across employees and departments.
3. **Age vs. Salary Correlation**: This analysis could reveal if there is a correlation between age and salary, indicating whether older employees tend to earn more, or if experience plays a more significant role.
4. **Employee Retention**: The retention analysis helps the company understand the percentage of employees who leave the company and can provide a basis for investigating employee satisfaction and retention strategies.

### **Step 6: Save Insights and Further Analysis**

Once we have identified trends and insights, we can present the findings in a report or dashboard. If needed, we can also export the processed dataset for further analysis:

```python
# Export the cleaned and analyzed data
data.to_csv('cleaned_employee_data.csv', index=False)
```

---

### **Summary:**

In this simple case study, we demonstrated how to load, clean, and analyze employee data using Python and Pandas. By visualizing and analyzing the data, we were able to uncover trends related to employee distribution, salary, and retention. This approach can be expanded to more complex data analysis and predictive modeling based on the company's needs.
