## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Correlation?

### üîπ **Definition:**

Correlation is a **statistical measure** that indicates the **strength and direction of a linear relationship** between two variables.

Mathematically, for variables $X$ and $Y$, the **Pearson correlation coefficient** is:

$$
r = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
$$

* $r = 1$: Perfect positive correlation
* $r = -1$: Perfect negative correlation
* $r = 0$: No linear correlation

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Compute Correlation in Python Using `pandas`

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'StudyHours': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Scores': [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Compute Pearson correlation
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

print(correlation_matrix)
```

### üìå Output:

```
            StudyHours    Scores
StudyHours       1.0        1.0
Scores           1.0        1.0
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Case Study: Restaurant Bill Analysis

Using Seaborn‚Äôs **`tips` dataset**, which contains restaurant bills and tips.

```python
import seaborn as sns

df = sns.load_dataset('tips')
```

### üîç Compute Correlation

```python
correlation_matrix = df.corr(numeric_only=True)
print(correlation_matrix)
```

### üìà Visualizing with Pair Plot

```python
sns.pairplot(df[['total_bill', 'tip', 'size']])
```

### üìä Heatmap

```python
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Pair Plot

A **pair plot** is a collection of scatter plots that helps explore relationships among multiple variables.

* **Diagonal**: Show variable distributions.
* **Off-diagonal**: Show pairwise scatter plots.
* Helps **visually confirm** correlation values.

## üß† Key Takeaways

* **Correlation** measures **linear dependence** between variables.
* `pandas` makes correlation computation easy.
* Pair plots and heatmaps are **powerful tools** for visual inspection.
* Correlation analysis is **foundational** in data science, statistics, and research.

# Correlation Analysis in Python for Data Analysis

Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables change together. In Python, we can calculate correlation using several methods. Here's a comprehensive guide with examples:

## Common Correlation Methods

1. **Pearson Correlation**: Measures linear relationship between continuous variables
2. **Spearman Correlation**: Measures monotonic relationship (linear or non-linear)
3. **Kendall Tau**: Measures ordinal association

## Example with Pandas and NumPy

Let's analyze correlation using the famous Iris dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)

# Display first few rows
print(df.head())

# Calculate Pearson correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr(method='pearson')  # Can also use 'spearman' or 'kendall'
print("\nPearson Correlation Matrix:")
print(corr_matrix)
```

## Visualizing Correlation

```python
# Heatmap visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap of Iris Features")
plt.show()

# Pairplot to visualize relationships
sns.pairplot(df)
plt.show()
```

## Calculating Specific Correlations

```python
# Calculate correlation between two specific columns
sepal_length = df['sepal length (cm)']
sepal_width = df['sepal width (cm)']

pearson_corr = sepal_length.corr(sepal_width)
spearman_corr = sepal_length.corr(sepal_width, method='spearman')

print(f"\nPearson correlation between sepal length and width: {pearson_corr:.2f}")
print(f"Spearman correlation between sepal length and width: {spearman_corr:.2f}")
```

## Correlation with p-values

For more statistical rigor, you can calculate p-values along with correlation coefficients:

```python
from scipy import stats

# Calculate Pearson correlation with p-value
pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(df['sepal length (cm)'], df['petal length (cm)'])
print(f"\nPearson coefficient: {pearson_coef:.3f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.3f}")

# Interpretation
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("The correlation is statistically significant")
else:
    print("The correlation is not statistically significant")
```

## Handling Non-Numeric Data

For categorical-numerical correlations, you can use ANOVA or point-biserial correlation:

```python
# Add target column (which is categorical)
df['species'] = iris.target

# Point-biserial correlation (between binary and continuous)
from scipy.stats import pointbiserialr

corr, p_value = pointbiserialr(df['species'], df['petal length (cm)'])
print(f"\nPoint-biserial correlation: {corr:.3f}, p-value: {p_value:.3f}")
```

## Important Notes About Correlation

1. Correlation ‚â† Causation: Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other
2. Sensitive to outliers: Extreme values can distort correlation measures
3. Only measures linear relationships (Pearson) or monotonic relationships (Spearman)
4. Range is from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive), with 0 indicating no correlation

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of correlation analysis in more detail?

## üìù Assignment Suggestion

* Choose a real-world dataset (e.g., cars, medical, sales).
* Calculate the correlation matrix.
* Visualize using heatmaps and pair plots.
* Interpret two strong/weak correlations and explain why they exist.
