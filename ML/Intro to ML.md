Lecture 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

1. Lecture Objectives

Understand the definition and purpose of Machine Learning (ML)

Differentiate ML from traditional programming

Explore basic types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning

Discuss key real-world applications of ML

Overview of the ML workflow

2. Introduction to Machine Learning

Definition

> Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.



Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning

Traditional Programming	Machine Learning

Rules + Data → Output	Data + Output → Rules (Model)
Programmer specifies logic	Model learns logic from data

3. Types of Machine Learning

a. Supervised Learning

Definition: Model is trained on labeled data

Examples: Regression, Classification

Use Case: Spam detection, house price prediction


b. Unsupervised Learning

Definition: Model explores data without labeled outputs

Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

Use Case: Customer segmentation, topic modeling


c. Reinforcement Learning

Definition: Learning by trial-and-error using rewards and penalties

Use Case: Robotics, Game playing, Autonomous vehicles

4. Real-World Applications

Healthcare: Disease prediction, medical imaging

Finance: Credit scoring, fraud detection

Retail: Recommendation systems

Transportation: Route optimization, autonomous driving

Agriculture: Crop disease detection, yield prediction
