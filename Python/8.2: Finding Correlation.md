---

## üéØ **Learning Objectives**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Correlation?

### üîπ **Definition:**

Correlation is a **statistical measure** that indicates the **strength and direction of a linear relationship** between two variables.

Mathematically, for variables $X$ and $Y$, the **Pearson correlation coefficient** is:

$$
r = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
$$

* $r = 1$: Perfect positive correlation
* $r = -1$: Perfect negative correlation
* $r = 0$: No linear correlation

### üîπ **Types of Correlation:**

| Type               | Description                        | Example                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Positive**       | Both variables increase together   | Height vs Weight                |
| **Negative**       | One increases, the other decreases | Exercise time vs Body fat       |
| **No Correlation** | No discernible linear relationship | Shoe size vs Intelligence score |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why is Correlation Important?

### üîç **Significance of Correlation in Data Analysis:**

| Purpose                         | Explanation                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Feature Selection**        | Identify redundant or influential features in machine learning models.       |
| **2. Hypothesis Testing**       | Determine relationships to validate or reject assumptions.                   |
| **3. Trend Detection**          | Understand how one variable affects another (e.g., income vs spending).      |
| **4. Business Decision Making** | Discover patterns like sales vs marketing spend, or temperature vs demand.   |
| **5. Risk Assessment**          | In finance, to analyze how assets move together (portfolio diversification). |

### ‚úÖ Example Scenarios:

* In healthcare: Correlation between **blood pressure** and **sodium intake**.
* In education: Correlation between **study time** and **exam performance**.
* In retail: Correlation between **holiday season** and **sales revenue**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Compute Correlation in Python Using `pandas`

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'StudyHours': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Scores': [40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Compute Pearson correlation
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

print(correlation_matrix)
```

### üìå Output:

```
            StudyHours    Scores
StudyHours       1.0        1.0
Scores           1.0        1.0
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Case Study: Restaurant Bill Analysis

Using Seaborn‚Äôs **`tips` dataset**, which contains restaurant bills and tips.

```python
import seaborn as sns

df = sns.load_dataset('tips')
```

### üîç Compute Correlation

```python
correlation_matrix = df.corr(numeric_only=True)
print(correlation_matrix)
```

### üìà Visualizing with Pair Plot

```python
sns.pairplot(df[['total_bill', 'tip', 'size']])
```

### üìä Heatmap

```python
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Pair Plot

A **pair plot** is a collection of scatter plots that helps explore relationships among multiple variables.

* **Diagonal**: Show variable distributions.
* **Off-diagonal**: Show pairwise scatter plots.
* Helps **visually confirm** correlation values.

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

* **Correlation** measures **linear dependence** between variables.
* `pandas` makes correlation computation easy.
* Pair plots and heatmaps are **powerful tools** for visual inspection.
* Correlation analysis is **foundational** in data science, statistics, and research.

---

## üìù Assignment Suggestion

* Choose a real-world dataset (e.g., cars, medical, sales).
* Calculate the correlation matrix.
* Visualize using heatmaps and pair plots.
* Interpret two strong/weak correlations and explain why they exist.
