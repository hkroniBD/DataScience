## **2. Understanding Data Analysis**
### **What is Data Analysis?**
- Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and interpreting data to extract useful insights for decision-making.
- Unlike Data Science, which involves building predictive models, Data Analysis primarily focuses on understanding past data and making data-driven decisions.

### **Types of Data Analysis**

1. **Descriptive Analysis** – Summarizing historical data (e.g., sales reports, trend analysis).
2. **Diagnostic Analysis** – Identifying causes of trends or anomalies (e.g., why sales dropped in a particular month).
3. **Predictive Analysis** – Using past data to make future predictions (e.g., forecasting future revenue).
4. **Prescriptive Analysis** – Recommending actions based on data analysis (e.g., suggesting marketing strategies to improve sales).

### **Data Analysis Tools & Techniques**
- **Excel, Google Sheets** – Basic statistical analysis and visualization.
- **SQL** – Managing and querying large datasets.
- **Python, R** – Advanced data analysis and visualization.
- **Tableau, Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting.
- **Statistical Methods** – Regression analysis, hypothesis testing, clustering, and correlation analysis.

### **Steps in Data Analysis Process**

1. **Defining the Problem Statement** – Understanding what needs to be analyzed.
2. **Collecting Data** – Gathering data from relevant sources.
3. **Cleaning and Preprocessing Data** – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Summarizing data using visualizations.
5. **Applying Analytical Models** – Using statistical or machine learning models to extract insights.
6. **Interpreting Results** – Deriving meaningful conclusions from analysis.
7. **Communicating Findings** – Presenting results through reports, charts, and presentations.
